First, let's identify all the profile queries in the codebase. From the given files, we can see that the profile-related queries are located in the \`db/queries/profiles-queries.ts\` file. The functions we need to focus on are:

1. \`createProfile\`
2. \`getProfileByUserId\`
3. \`updateProfile\`

These functions interact with the database and are likely to throw errors if something goes wrong during the database operations.

  <thought_text>
For each of these functions, we need to implement a try-catch block to handle potential errors. The try block will contain the existing code, while the catch block will handle any errors that occur during the execution of the database operations.

We should also consider adding more specific error types or custom error classes to provide more informative error messages to the client.

  <thought_text>
In addition to adding try-catch blocks, we should implement proper error logging. This will help in debugging and monitoring the application. We can use the existing \`console.error\` for basic logging, but in a production environment, we might want to consider using a more robust logging solution.

We should also consider how to handle different types of errors. For example:

- Database connection errors
- Query execution errors
- Validation errors (e.g., missing required fields)
- User not found errors

Each of these error types might require different handling strategies or return different status codes/messages to the client.

It's important to ensure that the error handling doesn't expose sensitive information. We should create user-friendly error messages that provide enough information for the user to understand what went wrong, without revealing internal details about our system.

We should also consider adding input validation before executing database queries. This can help prevent errors caused by invalid input and improve the overall robustness of our application.

  <thought_text>
Lastly, we should update the return types of these functions to include potential error states. This will make it clear to the consumers of these functions that they need to handle potential errors.

  <thought_text>
To summarize, our plan for implementing comprehensive error handling for all profile queries will involve:

1. Adding try-catch blocks to all profile query functions
2. Implementing proper error logging
3. Handling different types of errors appropriately
4. Ensuring error messages are user-friendly and don't expose sensitive information
5. Adding input validation where necessary
6. Updating function return types to include error states

Let's proceed with implementing these changes in the \`db/queries/profiles-queries.ts\` file.
